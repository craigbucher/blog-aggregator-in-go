-- Add a CreateFeedFollow query. It will be a deceptively complex SQL query. It should insert a 
-- feed follow record, but then return all the fields from the feed follow as well as the names of 
-- the linked user and feed:

WITH inserted_feed_follow AS (
    INSERT INTO feed_follows (id, created_at, updated_at, user_id, feed_id)
    VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)
    RETURNING *

FROM inserted_feed_follow
INNER JOIN feeds ON inserted_feed_follow.feed_id = feeds.id
INNER JOIN users ON inserted_feed_follow.user_id = users.id;

-- Add a GetFeedFollowsForUser query. It should return all the feed follows for a given user
-- and include the names of the feeds and user in the result:
-- name: GetFeedFollowsForUser :many
